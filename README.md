This repository contains some datasets around football (soccer). The main dataset contains
results from ~1 million top-tier games.

# Football Results Dataset

`data/results` contains results of 1,078,214 football games in 207 top-tier domestic leagues and 
20 international tournaments (UEFA EuroLeague/ChampionsLeague,etc.) from 1888-2019. The files are 
split up by competition but all follow the same scheme.

## Rscipts

The folder `Rscripts` contains some R code with basic analyses which could get you going:

- `01_basic_stats.R`: very simple stats (number of games, goals, etc)
- `02_soccerverse.R`: some code for figures on soccerverse.com

## Disclaimer

This dataset definitely contains errors, especially for older games, where sources are not
as reliable. A big issue are teams that merge/split/dissolve over time, which (I think) I did
not resolve consistently over time.

I have gathered this dataset over the course of 8 years and put a lot of effort in
it (see [soccerverse.com](soccerverse.com)). If you use the data for any kind of project, please drop me a line
or ping me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/schochastics). I hapilly include your results on soccerverse.com too.

# formations/ linups
